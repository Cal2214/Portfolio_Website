                            In Frolic Frog, platforms, enemies, and other obstacles are dynamically spawned as the player progresses upwards, ensuring a unique playthrough each time. The game strikes a balance between easy and challenging platforms to keep players engaged. The spawning system is based on the player's position, ensuring that they are continually challenged as they ascend. <br>
                            
                            <div class="title"> Implementation</div>
                            Platforms are spawned at runtime based on the player's current height, with randomisation applied to their X and Y coordinates. Different platform types (e.g. breakable platforms, moving platforms, lily pads) are selected accordingly depending on their probability. To enhance player engagement, I implemented a difficulty curve that gradually increases as the player ascends. <br>
                            
                            <div class="title"> Design Approach </div>
                            ​​At the start, players encounter a high density of platforms and fewer obstacles, making it easier to learn the mechanics. As players progress higher, the number of platforms decreases while the frequency and variety of obstacles increase, creating a more challenging experience.<br>

        <label for="second">Object Pooling</label>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="title"> Description</div>
            Object pooling is used to optimize the performance of effects in the game, such as particles and special visuals. Instead of repeatedly creating and destroying these objects, a pool of pre-initialized objects is recycled, reducing memory usage and ensuring smoother gameplay. <br>
            
            <div class="title"> Implementation</div>
            The game uses object pooling for visual effects such as particle bursts when the player jumps. This ensures that the game runs smoothly, especially during intense moments with multiple effects on-screen.<br>
            
            <div class="title"> Design Approach </div>
            ​I decided to implement object pooling for the jump effect as a way to practice and enhance my understanding of pooling techniques in game development. While I only needed a single instance for the jump effect, utilizing pooling allowed me to experiment with the concept and prepare for potential future scenarios where multiple instances might be required. This practice also contributes to better performance management in cases where instantiating and destroying objects could lead to overhead.<br>

            In Frolic Frog, obstacles such as rocks, crocodiles, and breakable platforms challenge players as they ascend. Rocks serve as barriers, crocodiles add dynamic threats, and breakable platforms require strategic timing. This variety keeps gameplay engaging and encourages players to adapt their strategies. <br>
            
            <div class="title"> Implementation</div>
            Obstacles are spawned based on the player's height and progress using conditional statements that check the player’s score. For instance, as players progress, the frequency and variety of obstacles increase to match their skill level.  <br>
            
            <div class="title"> Design Approach </div>
            The design of obstacles ensures a balanced challenge that evolves with the player. Initially, simple obstacles allow for skill familiarization. As players ascend, obstacle density and complexity increase, promoting advanced strategies. Careful placement encourages exploration, with rocks leading to alternative routes and crocodiles creating intense moments. Playtesting informed adjustments to maintain gameplay flow and player engagement.<br>

            The player progression system in the game ensures that players feel a sense of advancement and reward as they continue to play. It tracks the player's score, money, and unlocks skins through a shop system. Players can earn currency by progressing through the game, which they can then use to unlock new skins, adding an extra layer of personalization and long-term engagement. Scores and currency are saved across sessions, ensuring that player progress is never lost. <br>
            
            <div class="title"> Implementation</div>
            The player’s highest score, current score, and in-game currency are stored persistently using a saving system. When the player earns enough in-game currency, they can access the shop to unlock new skins or items. The shop system checks for available funds and displays available skins for purchase. After unlocking, the selected skin is saved and applied to the player character on the next session or immediately after purchase.<br>
            
            <div class="title"> Design Approach </div>
            ​The design focuses on long-term engagement. By offering a shop where players can unlock new skins, the game incentivizes replay ability and introduces goals beyond just achieving a high score. The skin system is designed to appeal to player personalization, giving them a sense of ownership over their character.

            The saving system ensures continuity, allowing players to feel that their achievements and progression are meaningful and persist across sessions. This reduces frustration and increases motivation to continue playing and unlocking rewards.<br>

<!--------------------------------- WHAT I LEARNT --------------------------------->
<div class = "learn-container">
<div class = "learn-title">What I Learnt</div>

<div class = "learn-subtitle">Dynamic Player Progression Loop:</div>
<div class = "learn-text">One of the key challenges in Frog Doodle Jump was designing a dynamic and engaging gameplay loop that scales with player progression. I learned how to adjust the difficulty by increasing the challenge as the player progresses through the game. This included creating a difficulty curve where platforms become faster and obstacles increase in number, making the game more challenging and fun as the player advances. This progression system kept the gameplay fresh and ensured players stayed engaged.</div>

<div class = "learn-subtitle">Saving Player Data and High Scores:</div>
<div class = "learn-text">For the first time, I implemented a save system to track the player's progress, including their current score, high score, and selected characters. I learned how to serialize data and create a system that would save this information even after the game is closed and reopened. I also worked on displaying this data on the game over screen, ensuring players could see their achievements. This was essential for providing feedback to players about their performance and encouraging replayability.</div>

<div class = "learn-subtitle">Shop System and Unlocking Mechanisms:</div>
<div class = "learn-text">I developed a shop system where players could unlock new characters using in-game currency. This was my first time building a system that handled unlockable content, and I gained experience in managing an in-game economy. I learned how to save player choices (such as selected characters) and persist these selections across sessions. This experience deepened my understanding of how to balance game progression and reward systems to keep players motivated.</div>

<div class = "learn-subtitle">Polishing, Debugging, and Packaging:</div>
<div class = "learn-text">During the development of this game, I learned the importance of polishing and debugging. I made sure the game was free of bugs and optimized for performance, particularly when packaging the game for online play. I worked on making sure the user interface was intuitive, the controls were smooth, and the overall experience was free of interruptions. This was my first time preparing a game for public release and I learned how to debug efficiently and polish the final product for a professional standard.</div>

<!--------------------------------- RETROSPECTIVE --------------------------------->
<div class = "learn-container">
    <div class = "learn-title">Retrospective</div>
    
    <div class = "learn-subtitle">Object Pooling:</div>
    <div class = "learn-text">I implemented object pooling for the jump effect, as it allowed me to avoid constantly instantiating and destroying objects. However, I only applied it to a single type of object. In retrospect, I realized that platforms could benefit greatly from object pooling as well. Rather than destroying and spawning new platform objects as they leave the screen, I could have instead deactivated them, moved them to a new position, and then reactivated them. This would have reduced unnecessary object creation, thus improving performance, especially if the game expanded in scope. While it didn't significantly impact gameplay performance due to the small scale of the project, applying object pooling more broadly would have followed best practices and helped the game run more efficiently. Moving forward, I plan to implement object pooling more comprehensively in future projects, particularly for dynamic objects like platforms, obstacles, and enemies.</div>
    
    <div class = "learn-subtitle">Unplanned Features:</div>
    <div class = "learn-text">The addition of new characters and a shop system, which wasn't initially planned, significantly extended the project’s timeline. While it enhanced the game’s depth and replayability, it also created unforeseen delays. In hindsight, incorporating the shop system added complexity that could have been avoided or planned better in the early stages. Moving forward, I plan to be more mindful of scope creep and ensure that features are fully scoped out before implementation. This will help avoid delays and improve the overall development process.</div>
